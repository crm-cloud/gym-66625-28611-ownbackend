## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Breaking This Down Into Steps

This is a **3-4 week migration project**. We should NOT migrate everything at once.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Week 1**: Auth + Members + Branches (critical features)
2. **Week 2**: Trainers + Memberships + Classes
3. **Week 3**: Products, Orders, and remaining features
4. **Week 4**: Testing and bug fixes

### 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Set up environment variable**:
   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file (create if doesn't exist)
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```

2. **Ensure backend is running**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test health endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

4. **Ready for authentication migration**

## Current Configuration

### Frontend
- **Axios Client**: ✅ Configured
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Auth Token**: `access_token` in localStorage
- **Refresh Token**: `refresh_token` in localStorage
- **Token Refresh**: ✅ Automatic on 401

### Backend
- **Running**: Should be at `http://localhost:3001`
- **Health Check**: `GET /health`
- **Auth Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/login`
- **Total Endpoints**: 180+

---

## Testing Strategy

For each migrated hook:

1. **Unit Test**: Mock API calls
2. **Integration Test**: Test with real backend
3. **UI Test**: Verify UI updates correctly
4. **Error Test**: Test error scenarios

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Network Error" or "CORS Error"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure backend is running on port 3001
- Check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in backend `.env` includes `http://localhost:5173`
- Restart backend server

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized"
**Solution**:
- Clear localStorage tokens
- Login again to get fresh tokens
- Check JWT_SECRET matches between requests

### Issue: "Token expired"
**Solution**:
- Token refresh should happen automatically
- If not, check refresh token is valid
- Login again if needed

## What's Next?

After completing authentication migration, we'll move to:

1. **Members Management** (highest usage)
2. **Branch Context** (required for multi-branch)
3. **User Profiles** (required for profile pages)
4. **Trainers** (core feature)
5. Then systematically through remaining features

**Important**: We should migrate 5-10 hooks per session, test thoroughly, then move to the next batch. This ensures we catch issues early and don't break too many things at once.
